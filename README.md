- Copy `.env.SAMPLE` to `.env` and configure your environment variables

### Install project dependencies

- Run `npm install`

### Run the development server

- Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server.
- Make any required code changes. The dev server watches for changes and rebuilds in real-time.

## Contributing

### Add a new feature

- Create a new branch from `develop` following the Git Flow branching convention
- Make any code changes following Next.js best practices.
- Add any new unit tests

### Deploying the Static Web App to Development Env

- Create a pull request from your branch back into `develop`
- Once the changes have been approved, merge the pull request
- The `develop` pipeline will trigger, deploying to the DigitalOcean project `portfolio-dev`

### Deploying the Static Web App to Production Env

- Create a new release branch from develop in the format `release/vx.x.x` (Use semantic versioning for the new release version)
- Bump the package.json version version to the new release version
- Create a pull request from your release branch into `main`
- Once the changes have been approved, merge the pull request as a squash merge
- The `production` pipeline will trigger, deploying to the DigitalOcean project `portfolio`
- Lastly, create a pull request from `main` back into `develop` and merge.

The tool allows them to view all of the publicly available data associated with a sanctioned person. We tested various sanction checking tools, for example OFSI - HM Treasury and the government UK Sanctions List, and found the accuracy of my solution to be far superior to all of the other tools we tested against. The tool consists of 2 parts on the backend, a daily job which queries the latest dataset and stores them in a CosmosDB instance, and an API that performs a search against the database given a name as input. The front-end is a Next.js application that provides a search input field and interfaces with the API to show the set of results. I built the tool to perform a thorough search by consolidating several SQL queries to check against multiple search vectors such as aliases and abbreviated first names to ensure that no sanctions are missed.",

This has enabled ERGO to underwrite the sales of new insurance policies for their partner insurance companies through the AirDoctor platform, bringing in a large stream of new revenue. I was the sole developer working on the project, and drove it from it's conceptualization, all the way through to delivery of the enterprise-grade, production ready solution. Adhering strictly to best practice secure programming principals in both code and infrastructure, the final solution is extremely robust and secure. I also built a docker stack with local azure emulators to enable local development, mitigating the risks of performing any unwanted actions on an environment. This docker stack can be used for all development team projects going forward, providing an extra layer of security as well as offline development capability.",

      "description": "I was solely responsible for the architecture and design of the entire cloud infrastructure for a proposed new micro-site for UK Power Networks. I led the cloud and Front-End development teams during the design and planning phases, guiding them through the solution and implementation. The client preferred Azure as their cloud provider, and I worked closely with them to ensure that my infrastructure design complied with their strict security standards. After collaborating with the client's security team, I created an optimal cloud infrastructure solution that met their functional and security requirements. I analysed the functionality of the microsite to gather the data requirements and used this to devise the most efficient database schema for Cosmos DB. I also created detailed architecture diagrams and a comprehensive technical design breakdown of the Azure architecture, including justifications and decisions made for each service, along with implementation and configuration steps.",
